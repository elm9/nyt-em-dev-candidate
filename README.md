# New York Times "Top News" API

Using this single page website, the user is able to search for articles using a key word and date. The search will return the first ten articles matching the parameters provided by the user. If there are more than ten results a button will appear giving the user the option to view all the results on one page.

## Technologies Used

[Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) - the frontend framework, form, buttons, and cards are all created using Materialize
[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) - Moment.js helped with converting the date and time to a diffent timezone and simplifying the reformatting of the date and time
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - the JavaScript library everyone loves to hate, here it's mostly used for DOM manipulation
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display) - Playfair font used for the page header and card titles
